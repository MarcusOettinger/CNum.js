#  Class CNum

CNum.js is a javascript object plotting a representation of a number z in the
complex plane. The idea is to set a complex value via an algebraic expression,
transform it into different bases and draw a Gaussian plot (aka Argand
diagram). Here's a [demo page]{https://MarcusOettinger.github.io/CNum.js/}.

Graphics are drawn onto a html5 canvas - this should nowadays be supported by
most browsers.  
  
I wrote the code because I needed a dynamic plot of complex values in webpages
for a a basic maths lecture. It serves a purpose and is far from being cleanly
written, nicely formatted or similar.  
  
CNum.js uses some external libraries:

  * [jquery]{http://jquery.org}
  * [jcanvas]{http://calebevans.me/projects/jcanvas/} (drawing routines)
  * [mathjs]{http://mathjs.org} (that can do much more!)
Creates a CNum object - the complex value is set via an algebraic expression.  
  
Usage is simple: object = new CNum( expression ) creates a new complex number,  
e.g. **_ z = new CNum("2+i"); _**    will create **_z_** with the value
**_2+i_**  
.  
_Defined in: _ CNum.js.

Class Detail

**CNum**(expr) 

Parameters:

{string} **expr**

    a text representing a complex number. Cartesian, trigonometric and polar expressions can be used, e.g. '2+3i' or '12*exp(3i)'   
  

Method Detail

{CNum} **addCNum**(z2, options, resultoptions)

show the sum of two complex numbers in a Gaussian plot.

Parameters:

{CNum} **z2**

    the number to add
{options} **options**

    set appearance of the complex number to add (see CNum.options for a list of possible settings)
{options} **resultoptions**

    change appearance of the resulting complex number (see CNum.options for a list of possible settings)

Returns:

    {CNum} result of the operation as a CNum

* * *

**addToPlot**(z, options) 

add a CNum to an existing plot - may be used to plot several numbers on one
canvas at the same time. Caveat: the plot will not be rescaled nor cleared (of
course).

Parameters:

{CNum} **z**

    the complex number to add to the current plot
{options} **options**

    change plot appearance (see CNum.options for a list of possible settings)

* * *

**addVector**(z, x,y, change, options) 

add a CNum as a free vector to an existing plot - used to plot several numbers
on a single canvas. This method plots a CNum starting at a point (x/y), for
example to display sums of complex numbers. Caveat: the plot will not be
rescaled nor cleared (of course).

Parameters:

{CNum} **z**

    the complex number to add
{coordinate} **x,y**

    coordinates of the starting point
{options} **change**

    plot appearance (see CNum.options for a list of possible settings)
**options**
    

* * *

**displayGauss**(options, radius) 

Draw the complex number z as an arrow in the complex plane on the selected
canvas (set by setCanvas()). This method either plots a single CNum or the
first one in a series of CNums drawn onto the same canvas. Additional numbers
can be displayed on that canvas using addToPlot

Parameters:

{options} **options**

    change plot appearance (see CNum.options for a list of possible settings)
{optional number} **radius**

    scale the plot for a complex number of this value (default: autoscale)

See:

    setCanvas(): Set the canvas to draw on.
    addToPlot(): draw another number into an existing plot.

* * *

{float} **getradius**()

Return radius of the pointer

Returns:

    {float} radius of the complex number (norm)
